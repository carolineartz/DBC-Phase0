# Exercise: Defining a Hash
# Define a Hash variable called my_info which has the following keys:

# :first_name
# :last_name
# :hometown
# :age
# Use your own personal information to fill in the keys. Make sure :age is a positive integer and the rest are non-empty Strings.

# The Hash needs to be stored in the my_info variable.

my_info = {:first_name => 'Caroline',
           :last_name => 'Artz',
           :hometown => 'Ann Arbor',
           :age => 29}
